# CRTScraper
<h3>About this project</h3>
<p>This research tool was built to aid Professor Chenyu Wang in the study of how the social issues that transcend politics were used by different rhetoricians (politicians, educators, informed citizens, journalists, etc.). The requirements for this project were two-fold.</p>
<br>
<p>First, all articles that met the criteria for research were scraped and cataloged in a static database. In the specific case for this tool, the criteria were specific news publications, and mentions of the phrase “Critical Race Theory.” This was done using publicly available platforms like Google News, and by scraping news sources of the articles directly. </p>
<br>
<p>The second portion of the project was to build a web application to aid in the filtering and viewing of the data collected. In this way, Professor Wang would have a large data set to conduct research and understand how different journalists, pundits, and politician changed the conversation on Critical Race Theory over an election cycle.</p>
